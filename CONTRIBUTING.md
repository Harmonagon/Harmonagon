## Collaborators and Contributors

If you are a programmer interested in collborating with or contributing to the Harmonagon, please email the [project maintainier](mailto:mitch@harmonagon.com). No musical knowledge is required for programming, as music sequences are easily converted to binary and milliseconds. Programmers will need a basic understanding of geometry (transformations) and trigonometry (unit circle, sin, cos, tan, and radians).

### Refactoring

The [Harmonagon](http://www.harmonagon.com/) is an open-source music education app that is a work in progress; the app needs refactoring and significant updating to add new features and improve capabilities.
