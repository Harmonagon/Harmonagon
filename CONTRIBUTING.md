## Collaborators and Contributors

If you are a programmer, developer, designer, educator, or musician interested in collborating with or contributing to the Harmonagon, please email the [project maintainier](mailto:mitch@harmonagon.com). No prior musical knowledge is required, as music is easily converted to binary and milliseconds. Programmers will need a basic understanding of geometry (incl. transformations) and trigonometry (unit circle, sin, cos, tan, radians, etc.).
