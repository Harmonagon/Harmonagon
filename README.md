# Harmonagon

The [Harmonagon](http://www.harmonagon.com/) is an open-source music education app designed as a free teaching, learning, and practice tool for music students, educators, and musicians. No experience or musical knowledge is required; the Harmonagon may be used by anyone, including beginners and those without an instrument.

Watch this three-minute [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofEOS-WSSP0) for additional project background.

### Refactoring

The Harmonagon needs refactoring and significant updating to add new features and improve capabilities. See "planned updates" below.

### Collaborators/Contributors

The Harmonagon is unique as a music education tool because the free app can be used with any instrument and lacks any genre bias. The Harmonagon can be used by anyone, regardless of instrument, music style preference or ability. Watch [Using the Harmonagon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob1CdGbHpeA) for a detailed overview and demonstration of the current app.
