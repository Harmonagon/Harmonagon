# Harmonagonâ„¢

The [Harmonagon](http://www.harmonagon.com/) is a free music education app designed as a teaching, learning, and practice tool for music students, educators, and musicians. No experience or musical knowledge is required; the Harmonagon may be used by anyone, including beginners and those without an instrument. For more information and demo visit www.harmonagon.com or watch this three-minute introductory [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=rWmZq-XwtO8).
 
### License

This code is open-source and licensed under the MIT License - see [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/Harmonagon/Harmonagon/tree/master/LICENSE.md) for details.

### Acknowledgments/Attributions

The Harmonagon was created in 2016 by musician [Mitch Kahle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_f3nR0uGJ1VuBx9SgFG3zQ/videos) and programmer [Holly Huber](https://github.com/HollyJHuber). Watch this three-minute [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofEOS-WSSP0) for additional project background. The Harmonagon was built (in its current form) using JavaScript, HTML Canvas, CSS, [MIDI.js](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js) (sound), [vexflow](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow) (notation), and other libraries.

### Refactoring

The Harmonagon needs refactoring (full stack) and significant updating to add new features and improve capabilities. See "planned updates" below.

### Collaborators/Contributors

The Harmonagon is unique as a music education tool because the app can be used with any instrument and lacks any genre bias. The Harmonagon can be used by anyone, regardless of instrument, music style preference, or musical ability. Watch [Using the Harmonagon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob1CdGbHpeA) for a detailed overview and demonstration of the current app.

If you are a programmer, developer, designer, musician, or educator interested in collborating with or contributing to the Harmonagon, please email the [project maintainier](mailto:mitch@harmonagon.com). No prior musical knowledge is required, as music easily converted to binary and milliseconds. Programmers will need a basic understanding of geometry (incl. transformations) and trigonometry (unit circle, sin, cos, tan, radians, etc.).
